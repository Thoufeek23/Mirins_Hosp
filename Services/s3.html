        <h2>Endometriosis Medical Management</h2>
        <p>Endometriosis is a painful condition where tissue similar to the uterine lining grows outside the uterus, leading to chronic pelvic pain, heavy periods, and infertility. The medical management of endometriosis includes hormonal therapies like birth control pills, progestin, and GnRH agonists that help reduce the growth of the endometrial-like tissue. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are often used to manage pain. For women seeking pregnancy, fertility treatments may be offered. When medical treatments fail to alleviate symptoms, surgery may be considered to remove the endometriosis tissue. Endometriosis treatment is personalized, aiming to reduce symptoms and improve quality of life.</p>
        <h3>Treatment</h3>
        <p>At MIRINS Hospital, we offer a comprehensive medical management approach for endometriosis, aimed at alleviating pain and improving quality of life. Dr. Irshath Nasreen specializes in tailoring treatments to each patientâ€™s symptoms and reproductive goals. First-line management typically includes nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to reduce pain and inflammation. Hormonal therapies, such as combined oral contraceptives, progestin-only pills, or intrauterine devices (IUDs) with progestin, are often prescribed to suppress the growth of endometrial tissue and regulate menstrual cycles. For more severe cases, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists or antagonists may be utilized to induce a temporary hormonal "menopause," reducing lesions and associated pain. We also provide counseling on lifestyle adjustments and complementary therapies, ensuring a holistic approach to care. Our goal at MIRINS Hospital is to empower patients with effective treatment options while supporting their overall well-being.</p>

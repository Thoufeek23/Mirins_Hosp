        <h2>Menstrual Disorder</h2>
        <p>Menstrual disorders refer to irregularities in the menstrual cycle, such as heavy periods (menorrhagia), missed periods (amenorrhea), or painful periods (dysmenorrhea). These issues can stem from underlying conditions like PCOS, fibroids, thyroid disorders, or stress. Medical management of menstrual disorders includes hormonal treatments like birth control pills, IUDs, or progestin therapy to regulate cycles and manage symptoms. Other approaches include non-hormonal treatments such as pain medications, anti-inflammatory drugs, or lifestyle changes to reduce stress and improve overall health. For severe cases, surgical options like endometrial ablation or myomectomy may be considered. Treating menstrual disorders aims to restore a normal, healthy cycle and alleviate associated symptoms.</p>
        <h3>Treatment</h3>
        <p>At MIRINS Hospital, we specialize in diagnosing and treating a wide range of menstrual disorders to help patients achieve hormonal balance and improve their overall health. Under the care of Dr. Irshath Nasreen, we address conditions such as irregular periods, heavy or prolonged bleeding (menorrhagia), painful menstruation (dysmenorrhea), and absent periods (amenorrhea). Our diagnostic process includes a thorough medical history, hormonal evaluations, and ultrasound imaging to identify underlying causes like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), thyroid dysfunction, uterine fibroids, or endometriosis. Treatment is tailored to each patient and may include lifestyle modifications, medications such as hormonal contraceptives or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and minimally invasive procedures if necessary. At MIRINS Hospital, we are committed to providing compassionate care that supports patients in achieving menstrual health and well-being.</p>

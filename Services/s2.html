        <h2>Family Planning</h2>
        <p>Family planning involves controlling or planning the timing and spacing of children through various methods of contraception and reproductive health education. It includes options like oral contraceptives, intrauterine devices (IUDs), sterilization, and natural family planning methods. Healthcare providers help individuals and couples make informed decisions about the best contraception method based on their health, lifestyle, and reproductive goals. Counseling also addresses fertility preservation options for individuals who wish to delay childbearing or have certain medical conditions. Family planning services aim to promote reproductive health, prevent unintended pregnancies, and support individuals in making choices that align with their personal, economic, and social well-being.</p>
        <h3>Treatment</h3>
        <p>At MIRINS Hospital, we prioritize comprehensive family planning services to support individuals and couples in making informed decisions about their reproductive health. Dr. Irshath Nasreen, our experienced gynecologist, provides personalized counseling on contraception options, including oral contraceptives, intrauterine devices (IUDs), implants, and barrier methods, to suit diverse needs and lifestyles. For those planning for future pregnancies, we offer preconception counseling and health optimization strategies. Our services also include fertility preservation for patients facing medical treatments that may impact reproductive health. With a compassionate and patient-centered approach, MIRINS Hospital ensures that family planning is accessible, effective, and aligned with each individual's goals and values.

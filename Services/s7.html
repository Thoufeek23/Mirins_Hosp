        <h2>STDs</h2>
        <p>Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are infections passed from person to person through sexual contact. Common STDs include chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, and HIV, each of which can have long-term health consequences if left untreated. Regular screenings, especially for sexually active individuals, are essential for early detection. Treatment typically involves antibiotics or antiviral medications, depending on the infection type. Preventive measures include the use of condoms, vaccination (such as for HPV), and open communication with partners about sexual health. Healthcare providers offer education, testing, and treatment to help manage and prevent the spread of STDs, promoting sexual health and well-being.</p>
        <h3>Treatment</h3>
        <p>At MIRINS Hospital, we provide comprehensive care for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), emphasizing prevention, early diagnosis, and effective treatment. Dr. Irshath Nasreen leads our efforts in creating a safe and confidential environment where patients can seek help without stigma. Our services include routine screening for common STDs like chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, human papillomavirus (HPV), herpes, and HIV, along with detailed counseling on safe sexual practices. For patients diagnosed with an STD, treatment is tailored to the specific conditionâ€”antibiotics for bacterial infections such as chlamydia and gonorrhea, or antiviral medications for managing viral infections like herpes or HIV. We also offer HPV vaccinations to prevent certain infections that can lead to cervical cancer. At MIRINS Hospital, we prioritize patient education and support to ensure that treatment is effective and that recurrence risks are minimized, promoting long-term sexual and reproductive health.</p>

        <h2>Minimally Invasive Surgery</h2>
        <p>Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) refers to surgical techniques that use smaller incisions, specialized instruments, and advanced imaging technologies to perform procedures with less trauma to the body compared to traditional open surgery. The most common types of minimally invasive surgeries include laparoscopic (using a camera and small instruments inserted through small incisions), robotic-assisted surgery, and endoscopic surgery. These procedures are typically associated with shorter recovery times, less pain, reduced risk of infection, and minimal scarring. MIS is commonly used in a variety of specialties, such as gynecology, urology, orthopedics, and general surgery. Conditions like gallbladder disease, hernias, and certain cancers can be treated effectively with these techniques. Although minimally invasive surgery offers several benefits, it requires a high level of skill from the surgeon and specialized equipment, and it may not be suitable for all types of surgeries.</p>
        <h3>Treatment</h3>
        <p>At MIRINS Hospital, we offer cutting-edge minimally invasive surgery (MIS) to treat a variety of gynecological, urological, and other medical conditions with precision and minimal recovery time. Dr. Irshath Nasreen and our skilled surgical team are trained in advanced techniques such as laparoscopy and robotic-assisted surgery, which involve small incisions and the use of specialized instruments to perform procedures with minimal disruption to surrounding tissues. Minimally invasive surgery is often used for conditions such as fibroids, ovarian cysts, endometriosis, and certain cancers, as well as for procedures like hysterectomies, myomectomies, and gallbladder removal. These procedures typically result in less pain, reduced risk of infection, shorter hospital stays, and faster recovery times compared to traditional open surgery. At MIRINS Hospital, we prioritize the well-being of our patients by offering innovative surgical solutions that promote quicker recovery, fewer complications, and better overall outcomes.</p>

        <h2>Pregnancy</h2>
        <p>Pregnancy is the process in which a fertilized egg implants and develops in the uterus. Prenatal care involves regular check-ups to monitor the health of both the mother and fetus, including screenings, ultrasounds, and blood tests. Medical management during pregnancy may address common issues like morning sickness, gestational diabetes, or preeclampsia. Healthcare providers offer guidance on nutrition, exercise, and lifestyle adjustments to ensure a healthy pregnancy. In cases of complications, close monitoring and interventions, such as medication or early delivery, may be necessary. Comprehensive care during pregnancy aims to ensure a safe and healthy outcome for both mother and child.</p>
        <h3>Treatment</h3>
        <p>At MIRINS Hospital, we offer comprehensive and compassionate care throughout the pregnancy journey, from preconception counseling to postnatal support. Dr. Irshath Nasreen and our dedicated team ensure that every step of the pregnancy is monitored closely to promote the health of both mother and baby. We begin with preconception care, helping patients optimize their health before pregnancy through lifestyle advice, prenatal vitamins, and screening for any existing conditions that could impact pregnancy. Once pregnant, our services include regular ultrasounds, blood tests, and routine check-ups to monitor fetal development and maternal health, ensuring early detection of potential complications such as gestational diabetes or preeclampsia. In addition to routine care, we provide counseling on nutrition, exercise, and managing common pregnancy discomforts. At MIRINS Hospital, we are committed to providing a supportive and personalized experience to help mothers have a safe and healthy pregnancy.</p>

        <h2>Cesarean Section</h2>
        <p>A cesarean section (C-section) is a surgical procedure used to deliver a baby through an incision in the abdomen and uterus. It is often performed when vaginal birth poses risks to the mother or baby, such as in cases of fetal distress, breech presentation, or obstructed labor. Postoperative care for C-section patients includes monitoring for infection, pain management, and support for breastfeeding. While C-sections are generally safe, they carry risks such as longer recovery times, increased risk of infection, and potential complications in future pregnancies.</p>
        <h3>Treatment</h3>
        <p>At MIRINS Hospital, we provide expert care for cesarean section (C-section) deliveries, ensuring that both mother and baby receive the best possible care during and after the procedure. Dr. Irshath Nasreen and our team perform C-sections when medically necessary, such as in cases of fetal distress, breech presentation, multiple pregnancies, or if complications arise during labor that make a vaginal delivery unsafe. Our approach to a C-section is highly personalized, with careful consideration of the patient's health, preferences, and the specific circumstances of the pregnancy. The procedure is performed under spinal anesthesia or epidural anesthesia to ensure the mother remains comfortable and alert, while the baby is safely delivered through a small incision in the abdomen and uterus. Postoperative care includes pain management, monitoring for any signs of infection, and guidance on recovery, including how to care for the incision site and support breastfeeding. At MIRINS Hospital, our priority is the well-being of both mother and child, providing a supportive, informed, and compassionate environment throughout the C-section experience.</p>

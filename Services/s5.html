        <h2>Contraception</h2>
        <p>Contraception encompasses a variety of methods used to prevent pregnancy, with options ranging from hormonal (birth control pills, patches, IUDs) to barrier methods (condoms, diaphragms) and permanent solutions like sterilization. Each method has its benefits and drawbacks, and the choice depends on individual health, preferences, and lifestyle factors. Hormonal methods regulate menstrual cycles and can provide additional health benefits, such as reducing the risk of certain cancers. Barrier methods prevent both pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Healthcare providers offer counseling to help individuals and couples make informed decisions about the most suitable method for their needs.</p>
        <h3>Treatment</h3>
        <p>At MIRINS Hospital, we provide comprehensive contraception services tailored to meet individual needs and reproductive goals. Dr. Irshath Nasreen offers thorough counseling to help patients choose the most suitable contraceptive method based on their health, lifestyle, and preferences. Options include short-term methods like oral contraceptive pills, patches, and injections, as well as long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) such as intrauterine devices (IUDs) and contraceptive implants. For those seeking permanent solutions, procedures like tubal ligation are available. We also provide guidance on natural family planning methods for those who prefer hormone-free options. With a focus on education and patient empowerment, MIRINS Hospital ensures that everyone has access to safe, effective, and personalized contraception solutions.</p>

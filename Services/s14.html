        <h2>Urinary Tract Infection (UTI)</h2>
        <p>A urinary tract infection (UTI) is an infection in any part of the urinary system, typically caused by bacteria. Symptoms include painful urination, frequent urge to urinate, and lower abdominal discomfort. UTIs are most commonly treated with antibiotics, and itâ€™s important to complete the prescribed course to prevent reinfection or complications. Preventive measures, such as drinking plenty of water, urinating after sexual activity, and wiping from front to back, help reduce the risk of UTIs. Regular screenings are recommended for individuals with recurrent UTIs to rule out underlying conditions.</p>
        <h3>Treatment</h3>
        <p>At MIRINS Hospital, we offer prompt and effective treatment for urinary tract infections (UTIs), a common condition that can cause discomfort and potential complications if left untreated. Dr. Irshath Nasreen and our team diagnose UTIs through urine tests to identify the specific bacteria causing the infection. Treatment typically involves a course of antibiotics tailored to the type of infection. We ensure that patients understand the importance of completing their antibiotic regimen to fully eradicate the infection. In addition to antibiotic therapy, we provide advice on lifestyle changes to prevent future UTIs, such as proper hydration, urinating after intercourse, and maintaining good personal hygiene. For recurrent UTIs, we explore additional treatments such as preventive antibiotics or lifestyle adjustments. In cases of complicated UTIs, especially those involving the kidneys, we may recommend further tests to assess the extent of the infection. At MIRINS Hospital, we prioritize effective care and prevention strategies to help patients recover quickly and maintain urinary health.</p>

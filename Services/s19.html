        <h2>Ectopic Pregnancy</h2>
        <p>An ectopic pregnancy occurs when a fertilized egg implants outside the uterus, most commonly in the fallopian tube. This is a medical emergency because as the pregnancy grows, it can cause the tube to rupture, leading to life-threatening internal bleeding. Symptoms include abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, and dizziness. Diagnosis is confirmed with an ultrasound and blood tests. Treatment options depend on the size and location of the ectopic pregnancy and may include medication (such as methotrexate) to stop the pregnancy from developing or surgery to remove the ectopic pregnancy. Early detection and treatment are crucial to prevent complications, preserve the patient's fertility, and ensure overall health.</p>
        <h3>Treatment</h3>
        <p>At MIRINS Hospital, we provide specialized care for ectopic pregnancy, a serious condition in which a fertilized egg implants outside the uterus, typically in the fallopian tubes. Dr. Irshath Nasreen and our team are dedicated to quickly diagnosing and treating ectopic pregnancies to prevent complications such as tube rupture, which can lead to life-threatening internal bleeding. Diagnosis is made through a combination of blood tests to measure hormone levels and ultrasound imaging to locate the pregnancy. Treatment depends on the size and location of the ectopic pregnancy. In some cases, medications like methotrexate are used to stop the growth of the embryo and allow the body to absorb the tissue. For more advanced cases or when the fallopian tube is at risk of rupture, surgical intervention, such as laparoscopic surgery, may be required to remove the ectopic pregnancy while preserving as much of the reproductive tissue as possible. At MIRINS Hospital, we offer compassionate support throughout the process, providing counseling and follow-up care to help women recover physically and emotionally from this challenging experience.</p>

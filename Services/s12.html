        <h2>Menopause</h2>
        <p>Menopause marks the natural end of a womanâ€™s menstrual cycles, typically occurring between the ages of 45 and 55. It is accompanied by hormonal changes that cause symptoms such as hot flashes, night sweats, mood swings, and vaginal dryness. Medical management includes hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to alleviate symptoms and protect bone health, along with non-hormonal treatments like antidepressants or vaginal lubricants. Lifestyle changes, including exercise and a balanced diet, are also beneficial. Menopause is a natural life stage, and with proper medical care, most women can manage the symptoms and lead a healthy, fulfilling life.</p>
        <h3>Treatment</h3>
        <p>At MIRINS Hospital, we provide comprehensive care and support for women navigating menopause, a natural transition in life that can bring physical and emotional changes. Dr. Irshath Nasreen and our team offer personalized treatment plans to address the symptoms of menopause, such as hot flashes, night sweats, mood swings, and changes in sleep patterns. Our approach includes lifestyle counseling on diet, exercise, and stress management to improve overall well-being during this stage. For more severe symptoms, we offer medical options like hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to help regulate hormone levels and alleviate discomfort. Non-hormonal treatments, including medications for mood swings or vaginal dryness, are also available for women who cannot or prefer not to use HRT. Additionally, we provide screenings for osteoporosis and cardiovascular health, which are important considerations during menopause. At MIRINS Hospital, we are dedicated to ensuring that women experience this phase of life with the care, understanding, and medical support they deserve.</p>

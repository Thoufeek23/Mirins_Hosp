        <h2>Dilation and Curettage (D&C)</h2>
        <p>Dilation and curettage (D&C) is a surgical procedure in which the cervix is dilated, and the lining of the uterus is scraped or suctioned out. It is commonly performed to treat abnormal uterine bleeding, remove tissue after a miscarriage, or for diagnostic purposes when investigating uterine conditions such as polyps or cancer. The procedure is done under anesthesia, and patients typically recover quickly. D&C can be used to manage certain gynecological conditions or to obtain tissue samples for further examination. It is generally considered a safe procedure but carries some risks, including infection, injury to the uterus, and excessive bleeding.</p>
        <h3>Treatment</h3>
        <p>At MIRINS Hospital, Dilation and Curettage (D&C) is performed with the utmost care and precision to treat a variety of gynecological conditions. Dr. Irshath Nasreen and our medical team utilize this procedure to remove tissue from the uterus, often following abnormal uterine bleeding, miscarriage, or to clear the uterine lining after certain conditions like endometrial hyperplasia. The procedure involves dilating the cervix and using a curette or suction device to gently remove tissue from the uterus. D&C is typically done under general or regional anesthesia, ensuring the patient is comfortable throughout the procedure. Afterward, patients are closely monitored for any complications such as infection or excessive bleeding. Our team provides thorough post-procedure care, including instructions on rest, pain management, and follow-up appointments to ensure full recovery. At MIRINS Hospital, we prioritize patient safety and well-being, offering comprehensive care before, during, and after the D&C procedure.</p>

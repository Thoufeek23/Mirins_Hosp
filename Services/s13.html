        <h2>Urinary Incontinence</h2>
        <p>Urinary incontinence is the involuntary leakage of urine, which can occur due to weakened pelvic floor muscles, neurological conditions, or urinary tract infections. The condition is common, especially in older adults and women post-childbirth. Treatment options include pelvic floor exercises, bladder training, medications, and lifestyle modifications to reduce symptoms. In some cases, surgical treatments such as sling procedures or bladder implants may be considered. Managing urinary incontinence improves quality of life by reducing discomfort and restoring confidence in everyday activities.</p>
        <h3>Treatment</h3>
        <p>At MIRINS Hospital, we provide specialized care for urinary incontinence, a condition that affects many individuals but is often treatable with the right approach. Dr. Irshath Nasreen and our multidisciplinary team focus on diagnosing the underlying causes of urinary incontinence, which can include factors like pelvic floor muscle weakness, bladder infections, or neurological conditions. We offer a range of diagnostic tests, including bladder function tests and urodynamics, to determine the most appropriate treatment plan. For mild cases, we may recommend lifestyle changes, pelvic floor exercises, and bladder training to strengthen muscles and improve control. Medications, such as anticholinergics or beta-3 agonists, may be prescribed to help manage symptoms by relaxing the bladder or increasing its capacity. For more severe cases, we offer advanced options such as physical therapy with biofeedback, minimally invasive procedures like botulinum toxin injections, or surgical interventions if needed. At MIRINS Hospital, we are committed to providing compassionate care that addresses the physical and emotional aspects of urinary incontinence, helping patients regain confidence and quality of life.</p>

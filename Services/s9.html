        <h2>Uterine Fibroids</h2>
        <p>Uterine fibroids are non-cancerous tumors that develop in the wall of the uterus and can cause symptoms like heavy menstrual bleeding, pelvic pain, and infertility. Treatment options depend on the size, location, and severity of symptoms. Medications such as hormone therapy can help shrink fibroids, while non-invasive treatments like uterine artery embolization or minimally invasive surgery (myomectomy) are used to remove fibroids. For severe cases or when other treatments fail, a hysterectomy may be recommended. Uterine fibroid management focuses on alleviating symptoms and preserving fertility when possible.</p>
        <h3>Treatment</h3>
        <p>At MIRINS Hospital, we offer expert care for uterine fibroids, a common condition that affects many women during their reproductive years. Under the guidance of Dr. Irshath Nasreen, we provide a comprehensive approach to diagnosing and treating fibroids, which are non-cancerous growths in the uterus that can cause symptoms like heavy menstrual bleeding, pelvic pain, and frequent urination. Our diagnostic services include pelvic exams, ultrasounds, and MRI scans to determine the size, location, and number of fibroids. Treatment options are personalized and depend on the severity of symptoms and the patient's reproductive goals. For women with mild symptoms, hormonal treatments, such as birth control pills or intrauterine devices (IUDs), may help regulate bleeding and reduce pain. In cases where fibroids cause significant discomfort or fertility issues, minimally invasive procedures like uterine artery embolization or laparoscopic myomectomy may be recommended. For women seeking a more permanent solution, a hysterectomy may be considered. At MIRINS Hospital, we are dedicated to providing individualized care that addresses both the physical and emotional aspects of living with uterine fibroids.</p>

        <h2>Pelvic Floor Dysfunction</h2>
        <p>Pelvic floor dysfunction involves a range of conditions that affect the muscles and connective tissues in the pelvic area, leading to symptoms such as urinary incontinence, pelvic pain, or prolapse of pelvic organs. These conditions can be caused by childbirth, aging, obesity, or certain medical conditions. The treatment often begins with pelvic floor exercises or physical therapy designed to strengthen the muscles supporting the bladder, uterus, and rectum. Other interventions include medications, behavioral therapies, and lifestyle changes to manage symptoms. In severe cases, surgical procedures like pelvic reconstructive surgery may be necessary to restore normal function and improve quality of life.</p>
        <h3>Treatment</h3>
        <p>At MIRINS Hospital, we provide specialized care for pelvic floor dysfunction, focusing on restoring function and improving quality of life. Dr. Irshath Nasreen and our multidisciplinary team assess each patient comprehensively to determine the underlying causes, which may include muscle weakness, tightness, or coordination issues. Treatment begins with personalized pelvic floor physical therapy, where patients learn targeted exercises and techniques to strengthen or relax the pelvic muscles as needed. We also offer biofeedback therapy to help patients gain better control over these muscles. In some cases, medication may be prescribed to address associated symptoms such as pain, urinary incontinence, or constipation. For severe or persistent conditions, minimally invasive procedures or surgical interventions may be recommended. Our compassionate and patient-centered approach ensures that every individual receives the support and care they need to regain comfort and functionality.</p>

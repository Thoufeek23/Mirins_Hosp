        <h2>Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility</h2>
        <p>Reproductive endocrinology and infertility focus on diagnosing and treating hormonal imbalances that affect reproductive health. This branch of medicine covers a wide range of issues, including polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), endometriosis, male infertility, and hormone-related disorders. Treatment options often include medications to regulate ovulation, lifestyle modifications, and assisted reproductive technologies like in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intrauterine insemination (IUI). Reproductive endocrinologists assess both male and female fertility, addressing the root causes through advanced diagnostic testing, such as hormone testing and imaging. The goal is to improve fertility outcomes and manage conditions affecting reproduction, ensuring patients can achieve their family-building goals.</p>
        <h3>Treatment</h3>
        <p>At MIRINS Hospital, our approach to reproductive endocrinology and infertility is centered on delivering personalized, evidence-based care to patients. Under the expertise of our gynecologist, Dr. Irshath Nasreen, we address a wide range of conditions such as hormonal imbalances, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), endometriosis, and other fertility-related challenges. Our services include advanced diagnostic evaluations like hormone testing, ultrasound imaging, and ovulation monitoring to identify specific concerns. Treatment options are tailored to each patient, ranging from lifestyle and dietary interventions to medications for hormonal regulation or ovulation stimulation. For couples seeking assistance with conception, we provide counseling and collaborate with specialists to offer advanced reproductive technologies, including intrauterine insemination (IUI) and in-vitro fertilization (IVF). At MIRINS, we are committed to guiding patients with compassion and expertise toward achieving their family goals.</p>

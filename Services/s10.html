        <h2>Abnormal Cervical Screening Tests</h2>
        <p>Abnormal cervical screening tests, such as Pap smears or HPV tests, can detect early signs of cervical cancer or precancerous changes. Follow-up typically includes a colposcopy, where a doctor uses a special microscope to examine the cervix. A biopsy may be performed to confirm any abnormal cell changes. Treatment may include cryotherapy or LEEP (loop electrosurgical excision procedure) to remove abnormal tissue. Early detection and management of cervical abnormalities are crucial for preventing the progression to cervical cancer, and regular screenings help ensure timely intervention.</p>
        <h3>Treatment</h3>
        <p>At MIRINS Hospital, we provide expert care for women with abnormal cervical screening test results, ensuring a thorough evaluation and personalized treatment plan. Dr. Irshath Nasreen and our team work closely with patients to explain the significance of abnormal results, which can be caused by factors such as HPV infection, cervical dysplasia, or other changes in cervical cells. Our diagnostic process includes follow-up tests such as colposcopy, a procedure that allows for a detailed examination of the cervix, and biopsy if necessary, to assess the extent of any abnormal cell changes. Treatment options depend on the severity of the abnormalities. For mild cases, monitoring and regular follow-up screenings may be sufficient, while more advanced cases may require procedures such as cryotherapy, laser treatment, or loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) to remove abnormal tissue. We also offer HPV vaccinations to reduce the risk of future infections that could lead to cervical cancer. At MIRINS Hospital, we are committed to providing compassionate care and ensuring that patients receive the necessary treatment and support to maintain their cervical health.</p>

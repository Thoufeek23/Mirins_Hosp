        <h2>Abnormal Uterine Bleeding</h2>
        <p>Abnormal uterine bleeding refers to heavy, prolonged, or irregular menstrual bleeding that occurs outside the normal menstrual cycle. Causes can include hormonal imbalances, fibroids, polyps, or underlying medical conditions. Treatment varies depending on the underlying cause and can include hormonal therapies, intrauterine devices (IUDs), or surgery to remove fibroids or polyps. In some cases, endometrial ablation may be recommended to control bleeding. The goal is to identify and treat the underlying cause while improving the patientâ€™s quality of life.</p>
        <h3>Treatment</h3>
        <p>At MIRINS Hospital, we provide comprehensive care for abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB), a condition that can affect women of all ages and may be caused by a variety of factors, including hormonal imbalances, fibroids, polyps, or underlying medical conditions. Dr. Irshath Nasreen and our team work closely with patients to determine the root cause of AUB through a detailed evaluation that includes a pelvic exam, ultrasound, endometrial biopsy, and blood tests. Treatment for AUB is tailored to the individual and may include hormonal therapies such as birth control pills, progestin, or an intrauterine device (IUD) to regulate bleeding. For women with fibroids or polyps, minimally invasive procedures like hysteroscopy or uterine artery embolization may be recommended to remove abnormal growths and reduce bleeding. In more severe cases, surgical options such as endometrial ablation or a hysterectomy may be considered. At MIRINS Hospital, we are committed to providing personalized, effective treatment that addresses both the physical and emotional aspects of abnormal uterine bleeding, ensuring the best possible outcomes for our patients.</p>
